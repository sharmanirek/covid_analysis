# covid_analysisâ€” nirek sharma's analysis of the novel caronavirus pandemic
* __api_sandbox__ where I play around with the covid tracking project's api (https://covidtracking.com/data/) and make some quick visualizations
* __scoring_sandbox__ where I formulate a propensity score for the number of infections (*I*) in a state. I posit that *I* is a latent variable that is inherently unknowable but is a function of known figures (i.e. positive test results/ estimated contact/ population...). Stay Tuned for more results.
